# playback-controller

Generic playback controls for web animations.

## Development

### Build

```
npm run build
```

### Dev server

The repository contains an *index.html* file in the base folder that shows a basic usage of the component. It imports the module from the *dist* folder, therefore it is required to build once before changes in the source code are applied. To run a dev server:

```
npx http-server
```

Then open http://localhost:8080 in the browser.
